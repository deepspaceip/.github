# Internet Protocol Suite for Deep Space Networking
This set of repositories contains various tools, simulation results and references about the use of the Internet Protocol suite for deep space networking. See more information at: [https://deepspaceip.github.io](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tiptop/about/).

## Deep Space IP Toolkit(DIPT)
DIPT is the set of software tools used for simulating and implementing IP in deep space. It consists of:

- [DIPT QUIC Workbench](https://github.com/deepspaceip/dipt-quic-workbench): a simulator of networks and links events using a profiled QUIC for deep space
- [DIPT SCHC Implementation](https://github.com/deepspaceip/dipt-schc-tap): An implementation of the [Static Context Header Compression(SCHC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/schc/about/) protocol to use on deep space links
- [DIPT HTTP Implementation](https://github.com/deepspaceip/dipt-http): An HTTP client and server implementation over deep space profiled QUIC
- [DIPT Netconf Proxy over QUIC Implementation](https://github.com/deepspaceip/dipt-netconf-over-quic-proxy): an implementation of a netconf proxy over QUIC enabling netconf over deep space links
- [Deepspace Quiche](https://github.com/deepspaceip/deepspace-quiche): A fork of the Quiche QUIC stack, modified to use a noop congestion controller
